Place your MP3 here and name it: countdown.mp3

This build auto-arms the timer on page load. Due to browser autoplay rules,
audio may be muted until the user interacts. A small "Enable Sound" pill will
appear—clicking it will start/resume audio immediately.

Tips for the track:
- Keep it 30–120 seconds. It will loop.
- Aim for moderate loudness (around -14 LUFS) to avoid clipping on phones.
